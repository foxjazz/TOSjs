                Tech On-Site builds cost competitive, custom desktop computers based on individual needs and budgets.

            <p class="scottstyleCopyNoFontSize">
                One important advantage Tech On-Site computers have over the big-name manufacturers is quality -
                we choose parts that are significantly more robust which increases the reliability and longevity of your investment.
                Big-name pc makers generally use the cheapest mass-produced parts available.

            <p class="scottstyleCopyNoFontSize">
                We offer a two-year labor warranty on all custom-built machines - double the industry standard.
                Parts are warranted by their specific manufacturers, typically between one and three years.
