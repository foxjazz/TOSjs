                    Viruses, Trojan horses,
                    rootkits, worms, spyware and adware - collectively called “malware” (short for “malicious software”) -
                    are common and significant issues for PC users. The problems they cause include annoying
                    pop-ups, significant performance degradation, data loss, system instability and even
                    complete system failure. Some malware present serious threats to financial
                    or other sensitive data and
                    personal privacy. Any malware issue should be considered potentially dangerous and
                    eliminated immediately.

                    Many of our customers ask, “How could I possibly have a
                    virus? I installed antivirus software.” The answer is that malware
                    is software code written by malicious programmers, many of whom are
                    very good at what they do. They find ways to circumvent antivirus
                    protection to implement their attacks. Although most antivirus
                    applications are quite effective, none are 100% capable of
                    preventing all malware infections.&nbsp;
