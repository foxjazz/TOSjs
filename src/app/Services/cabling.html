                    needs. Whether you need a line run from the basement to another
                    floor, from one room or office to another or a patch panel installed with

                    professionally.

                    One application we
                    frequently encounter is when a customer's wireless router can't reach an area where they need wireless access.
                    To solve this problem, we typically run an ethernet cable from the router to the area in
                    need of service and install a wireless access point. Wireless devices can
                    then get full-strength WiFi signals which optimizes data speeds.
