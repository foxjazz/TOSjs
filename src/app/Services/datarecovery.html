                <h2 class="DBlue">	Data Backup</h2>
                <p class="scottstyleCopyNoFontSize">Important data should be backed up regularly to an alternate,
                    reliable and secure source other than your computer’s system hard disc, as hard discs often fail.
                    Not having a reliable backup solution in place can lead to devastating and
                    costly problems for businesses, and heartbreak for those
                    who lose their electronic photos and videos. </p>
                <p class="scottstyleCopyNoFontSize">

                <h2 class="DBlue">	Data Recovery</h2>
                <p class="scottstyleCopyNoFontSize">
                    For a variety of reasons,
                    hard drives often fail, making the data on them inaccessible to an
                    operating system. It is also often incorrectly assumed that data
                    loss is permanent. At Tech On-Site, we understand how disturbing it
                    is to lose irreplaceable personal or business data. Fortunately, our
                    technicians can, in most instances, recover data using a variety of
                    means including sophisticated data recovery software.
